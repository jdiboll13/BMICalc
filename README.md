# BMICalc

This is my first iOS Xamarin app. This was a great "Hello World" app

BMI Calculator is built using Xamarin on Visual Studio Community for Mac 2017. It's written using C#. The calculation for BMI use kgs and meters. Since the traget of my app would be Americans, I added the calculations to switch from imperial to metric. Additionally, I was receiving a decimal that went to 3+ decimal places. I made it round to 2 decimal places.

The next step would be to add links to BMI tables. This would entail adding Gender and Age selections.
